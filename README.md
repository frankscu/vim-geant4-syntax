# vim-geant4-syntax

Basic syntax highlighting for the Geant4 Detector Simulation Framework
<http://geant4.cern.ch/>

## Usage

There are several methods for activating this plugin's syntax
highlighting:

| Command                     | Short hand            |
| :-------------------------- | :-------------------- |
| `:setfiletype cpp.geant4`     | `:setf cpp.geant4`      |
| `:set filetype=cpp.geant4`    | `:se ft=cpp.geant4`     |
| `:set syntax=cpp.geant4`      | `:se syn=cpp.geant4`    |



So long as Vim had detected the use of `c` , `cpp` or `cc` before,
which it almost certainly would if you have the following in your vimrc.

```VimL
filetype on
syntax enable
```

Although setting the filetype is more semantically correct, there can
be some issues with plugins that use the `&filetype` variable to add
functionality. If this occurs, then please inject the highlighting by
setting the `&syntax` variable, as described above.

Re√Øterating the safest method is to use:

```Vim:
:se syn+=.geant4
```
